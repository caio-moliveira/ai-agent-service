# üß† AI Agents Collection - Built with CrewAI

Welcome to the **AI Agents Collection**!  
This repository contains a series of mini-projects showcasing practical AI agents built with [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/).

Each folder inside this repository is a **self-contained agent project**, with its own goal, logic, and flow ‚Äî designed to demonstrate real-world applications of autonomous agents.
